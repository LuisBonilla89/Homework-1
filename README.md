# Horison Solutions Centre: Code Refactor

## Overview:

The main objectives of this project are:

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
## Acomplished tasks

1. Incorporation of HTML semmantics tags for better overall flow while following a logic structure (<nav> <header><main><section><aside><header><footer>)

2. Addedd a more descriptive website tittle

3. Consolidated redundancy in CSS file of some of the styling properties by grouping selector types under the same conditions. (i.e .benefit-lead, .benefit-brand, .benefit-cost {
    margin-bottom: 32px;
    color: #ffffff; )

4. Added alt attribute to all the images within the webpage to account for errors should the browser fails to load the project.
